#Team Mint application 
This web application provides a user-friendly interface to explore the SNPs found on chromosome 1 in 3929 samples from different populations around the world. Specifically, it allows users to perform two population genetic structure analyses on the data set provided; clustering using Principal Component Analysis and Admixture analysis. In these two analyses the user is able to select which populations or superpopulations to analyse each time. Additionally, the user can use a search feature to retrieve allele and genotype frequencies as well as other relevant information, such as clinical information for the SNPs of interest in the populations of interest. The user also has the option to search for genes of interest in the populations he chooses and all SNPs associated with those genes along with the relevant information will be shown. This can also be done by choosing a region of interest on chromosome 1. If multiple populations are selected in the latter three analyses an Fst matrix is automatically created showing how much the selected populations differ and the user has the option to download the matrix as a text file to be used in further analyses.
